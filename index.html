       <div class="connor">
      <p>The android known as Connor, or his model number RK800, is the very first character you play. His character was an advanced prototype designed to help investigate cases that involved androids. Later in the game, Connor will have to work with Lieutenant Hank Anderson to solve deviant cases.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Good ending (Deviant run): If you're looking to get a deviant run, you have to keep Connor alive and solve all of the cases that are playable to you. Once you do this, your final task for Connor is to locate the Jericho boat where the deviant androids stay. You will meet Markus, the leader of the deviants, and you have the option to either shoot him or become deviant. Once you click become deviant, Connor will stay deviant. There is one twist, if you manage to win the protest peacefully, Connor will meet Amanda in the Zen Guardan, where he originally talked to her about the deviant cases. This is where Connor will try to self-distruct by shooting Markus and himself to complete his mission. In order to get past this, you will have to make your way to the emergency exit where you place Connor’s hand on it. This will awaken Connor again and stop him from self-distructing.</p>
      <p>Bad ending (Non-deviant run): If you're looking to get a non-deviant run, you will have to either kill Connor multiple times or choose the most non-friendly options that they give you. (ex. Choosing the ones about completing the mission only.) When doing this, you will have to take down the deviant leader (Markus) and win the fight. When you do win the fight though, Connor will be terminated because they later create a faster prototype than Connor which is now RK900. With this ending, no matter what you do, Connor will die or be taken apart.</p>

      <img src="Images/Kara.jpg" alt="kara" 
      class="image">
      </div>
      <div class="kara">
        <p>Kara, known also by AX400, is the second character you meet in the game. Her model was designed to be a housemaid for humans. You find out soon that Todd WIlliams is the person's house that Kara looks after and that he has a daughter named Alice. Depending on what you do, Kara becomes Alice’s mother figure and they have to find a way across the border to escape being hunted.</p>
        <p>Good ending (Crossing the border): To achieve a good ending for Kara, you have to pick all passive choices for both Connor and Markus if you choose to steal the bus tickets from the family. When you make it to the border and choose not to sacrifice anyone, the person who will check you to see if you're an android or not will look at the news that displays on a screen. On the screen it will either show Markus, the leader of the androids, protesting violently or Markus protesting peacefully. If it's voilent, the person will rat you out and Kara gets killed at the border. If it's peaceful, he will let you go and Kara can cross the border.</p>
        <p>Bad ending (Kara or Alice dies): To get this ending, at any point in her story, if Kara fails to protect Alice from any situation they are in, Kara or Alice can die and her story ends.</p>

        <div class="center">
        <img src="Images/Markus.jpg" alt="Markus" class="image">
        </div>
        <div class="markus">
        <p>Markus, also known asRK200, is the last character to meet in the game. He was given to a famous painter named Carl after he got into an accident that left him paralized. Later in the game, Carl’s son Leo, breaks into Carl’s house to find a painting to buy more red ice. This drug causes rage and irrational thinking. While Carl tries to talk Leo out of his house, he asks Markus to get him out. While doing this, he becomes aggressive and you have the option to push Leo or do nothing. If you push Leo, he hits his head on a metal machine and gets knocked out. If you choose not to do anything Carl will get hurt. No matter the outcome of this, police will show up and will shoot Markus because they think that he did it.</p>
        <p>From this, you get thrown into an android junkyard and Markus rebuilds himself. Markus will bump into an android and he will give Markus the location to Jericho.</p>
        <p>Good ending (peaceful protest): When Markus gets to Jerchio, meets everyone, and goes on a quest with them to get parts for the other androids, he will become their leader. When this happens, if you choose to peacefully protest the lives of androids, you will get the good ending. To achieve this you have to make sure you pick all the options that involve not hurting any humans.</p>
        <p>Bad ending (violent protest): If you choose all the violent options that involve damaging or hurting anyone, Markus will start a war between humans and androids. If Markus wins the war, the soilders will retreat and Markus talks about how this is only the start of the war.</p>
